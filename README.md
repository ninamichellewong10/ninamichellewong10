### Hi there I'm Nina🐳

🤠 I am in my third year of Computer Science and am interested in Software Development and Design.

🔭 I’m currently working on a group project for my Software Development course where we are developing a clone of Chap's Challenge (1989 Atari game)! I am also      working on a project using Amazon's AWS and learning the basics of cloud networking.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in Java in collaborative projects. I am also learning about networks and command line programming.

🐙 I enjoy working collaboratively with others and individually.
